# Contributing to GoNote

Thank you for your interest in contributing to GoNote! 🎉

This document provides guidelines and expectations for contributing to the project. Please read through this before submitting pull requests or opening issues.

## 🤝 Our Philosophy

GoNote is designed to be:
- **Lightweight** - Fast, minimal dependencies, quick to deploy
- **Simple** - Easy to understand, maintain, and customize
- **Self-hosted** - Complete control over your data, no external dependencies
- **Privacy-focused** - Your notes stay on your server

When considering contributions, we prioritize:
1. Maintaining simplicity and ease of use
2. Keeping the codebase maintainable
3. Preserving the lightweight nature of the application
4. Staying true to the self-hosted, privacy-first mission

## 📋 Before You Start

### Discuss Major Changes First

**Before submitting a pull request for a major feature or significant change, please:**

1. **Open an issue first** to discuss the idea
2. **Wait for feedback** from maintainers
3. **Get approval** before investing time in implementation

This helps ensure that:
- Your effort isn't wasted if the feature doesn't align with project goals
- We can discuss the best approach together
- Multiple people aren't working on the same thing
- The feature fits well with the existing architecture

### What Counts as a "Major Change"?

- New features that add significant functionality
- Changes to core architecture or data models
- New dependencies or significant changes to existing ones
- UI/UX overhauls or major design changes
- Changes to the plugin or theme system architecture
- Breaking changes to the API

## 🚀 How to Contribute

### 1. Fork and Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/gonote.git
cd gonote
```

### 2. Create a Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
```

### 3. Make Your Changes

- Follow the existing code style
- Write clear, readable code
- Add comments for complex logic
- Test your changes locally
- Update documentation if needed

### 4. Test Your Changes

```bash
# Run the Go application (recommended)
cd go && go run cmd/server/main.go

# Or use Docker (Go backend)
cd docker/compose && docker-compose -f development.yml up

# Run Go tests
cd go && go test ./... -race

# Run E2E tests (requires running server)
npx playwright test --config=tests/playwright.config.ts --project=chromium
```

### 5. Commit Your Changes

Write clear, descriptive commit messages:

```bash
git commit -m "Add dark mode toggle to settings"
```

### 6. Push and Create a Pull Request

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Then create a pull request on GitHub with:
- A clear title and description
- Reference to any related issues
- Screenshots (if UI changes)
- Testing notes

## 📝 Code Style Guidelines

### Go

- Follow standard Go conventions (`gofmt`, `go vet`)
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Keep functions focused and small
- Add comments for complex logic
- Return errors explicitly, don't panic
- Use table-driven tests

### JavaScript

- Use modern ES6+ syntax
- Keep functions focused and small
- Comment complex logic
- Use 4-space indentation
- Prefer single quotes for strings

### General

- Keep code simple and readable
- Avoid over-engineering
- Prefer explicit over implicit
- Write self-documenting code when possible

## 🎨 Contributing Themes

Themes should:
- Follow the existing theme structure (see `shared/themes/` directory)
- Be well-tested across different content types
- Include proper contrast ratios for accessibility
- Be named descriptively (e.g., `ocean-blue.css`, not `theme1.css`)

## 🔌 Contributing Plugins

Plugins should:
- Follow the existing plugin structure (see `shared/plugins/` directory)
- Include documentation in `project-docs/user-guide/PLUGINS.md`
- Be optional and not break core functionality if disabled
- Follow the plugin configuration format

## 🌍 Contributing Translations

GoNote supports multiple languages through JSON locale files. Adding a new language is easy!

### How to Add a New Language

1. **Copy the English locale file:**
   ```bash
   cp shared/locales/en-US.json shared/locales/xx-XX.json
   ```
   Use the appropriate [BCP 47 language tag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag) (e.g., `pt-BR`, `ja-JP`, `zh-CN`).

2. **Update the `_meta` section:**
   ```json
   {
     "_meta": {
       "code": "xx-XX",
       "name": "Language Name",
       "flag": "🇽🇽"
     },
     ...
   }
   ```

3. **Translate all string values:**
   - Keep the keys exactly as they are (don't translate keys!)
   - Translate only the values
   - Preserve `{{placeholders}}` - they get replaced with dynamic values
   - Keep emoji prefixes like `✓`, `💡`, `📂` as they are universal

4. **Test your translation:**
   - Restart the application
   - Go to Settings → Language dropdown
   - Your new language should appear automatically
   - Click through the UI to verify translations

### Translation Guidelines

- **Be consistent** - Use the same terminology throughout
- **Match the tone** - GoNote uses friendly, concise language
- **Preserve formatting** - Keep `\n` for newlines in multi-line strings
- **Handle plurals simply** - It uses `{{count}}` placeholders (e.g., "hace {{count}}m")
- **Test date formats** - Dates are formatted using the browser's `Intl` API with your locale code

### What Gets Translated

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| UI Labels | Button text, panel titles, tooltips |
| Messages | Alerts, confirmations, prompts |
| Placeholders | Search box, editor hints |
| Relative times | "just now", "5m ago", "2d ago" |

### What Stays in English

- Technical terms: "Wikilinks", "Markdown", "HTML"
- Keyboard shortcuts in tooltips: "Ctrl+Z", "Esc"
- File extensions: ".md", ".json"

## 📚 Contributing Documentation

Documentation improvements are always welcome! Please:
- Keep language clear and concise
- Use examples where helpful
- Update related documentation when making changes
- Check for typos and grammar

## ❓ When PRs Might Not Be Accepted

Even if your idea is great, a PR might not be accepted if:

1. **It doesn't align with project goals** - We aim to keep GoNote lightweight and simple. Features that add significant complexity or dependencies may not fit.

2. **It wasn't discussed first** - Major changes should be discussed in an issue before implementation.

3. **It conflicts with existing work** - Sometimes we're already working on similar features or have different plans.

4. **It's too niche** - Features that only benefit a very small subset of users might be better as plugins.

5. **It adds unnecessary complexity** - We prefer simple, maintainable solutions over complex ones.

6. **It breaks backward compatibility** - Without a very good reason, we try to maintain compatibility.

### What to Do If Your PR Isn't Accepted

**Don't take it personally!** Here are some options:

1. **Fork and maintain your own version** - That's the beauty of open source! You can add any features you want in your fork.

2. **Create a plugin** - Many features can be implemented as plugins without changing core code.

3. **Revisit later** - Project priorities change. What doesn't fit now might fit later.

4. **Discuss alternatives** - We're happy to discuss if there's a simpler way to achieve your goal.
